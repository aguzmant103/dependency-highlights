# GitHub Dependency Explorer - Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview
The GitHub Dependency Explorer is a web application that allows users to discover which projects are dependent on a given GitHub repository. Users can input a GitHub repository URL and view a grid of cards showing the direct dependents of that repository, with features for sorting, infinite scrolling, and local caching.

## Project Goals
1. Provide an easy-to-use interface for exploring GitHub repository dependents
2. Deliver fast and efficient dependency information without requiring authentication
3. Create a responsive and modern user experience with minimal setup requirements
4. Implement local-first architecture for improved performance and simplicity

## User Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. URL Input
   - Accept GitHub URLs in both formats:
     - github.com/user/repo
     - https://github.com/user/repo
   - Validate URL format and repository existence
   - Display clear error messages for invalid inputs

2. Dependent Repository Display
   - Show repository cards in a grid layout
   - Display for each dependent:
     - Repository name
     - Last update date
     - Description (if available)
     - Star count
   - Implement infinite scroll pagination (50 items per batch)

3. Sorting and Organization
   - Sort repositories by:
     - Last updated date
     - Star count
   - Maintain sort preference during infinite scroll loading

4. Search History
   - Store recent searches in browser local storage
   - Persist history across browser sessions
   - Display search history for quick access

### User Interface Requirements
1. Layout
   - Clean, modern grid layout for repository cards
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes
   - Clear loading states and transitions

2. Error Handling
   - Snackbar/toast notifications for all error states
   - User-friendly error messages for:
     - Invalid URLs
     - Non-existent repositories
     - Empty dependent lists
     - API rate limits

3. Performance
   - Smooth infinite scrolling experience
   - Optimized loading states
   - Efficient caching mechanism

## Technical Requirements

### Framework and Architecture
1. Next.js Application
   - Latest stable version
   - TypeScript implementation
   - React Server Components where applicable

2. Data Management
   - Browser local storage for caching
   - No database requirement
   - Stateless architecture

3. API Integration
   - GitHub API integration for fetching dependents
   - Rate limit handling
   - Error handling and recovery

### Performance Requirements
1. Loading Times
   - Initial page load < 2s
   - Subsequent searches < 1s (with cache)
   - Smooth infinite scroll performance

2. Caching
   - Browser local storage implementation
   - Cache invalidation strategy
   - Optimized storage usage

## Success Metrics
1. Technical Metrics
   - Successful URL parsing rate > 99%
   - Error handling coverage for all edge cases
   - Lighthouse performance score > 90

2. User Experience Metrics
   - Smooth infinite scroll implementation
   - Responsive UI across device sizes
   - Clear error feedback

## Future Considerations (Out of Current Scope)
1. GitHub authentication integration
2. Support for private repositories
3. Extended dependency graph visualization
4. Support for other Git platforms
5. Advanced filtering options

## Development Phases
1. Initial Setup
   - Project scaffolding
   - Development environment configuration
   - Basic component structure

2. Core Features
   - URL input and validation
   - GitHub API integration
   - Repository card implementation
   - Infinite scroll functionality

3. Enhancement Features
   - Sorting implementation
   - Search history
   - Caching mechanism
   - Error handling system

4. Testing and Optimization
   - Performance testing
   - Error scenario testing
   - UI/UX refinement
